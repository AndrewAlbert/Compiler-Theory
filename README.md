# Compiler-Theory
Compiler written for the University of Cincinnati class EECE6083: Compiler Theory and Practice. The goal of this project is to hand build a simple recursive descent LL(1) compiler by hand (not using compiler construction tools such as flex or antlr) utilizing the C++ programming language and a simple C file format for the code generation. The language to be compiled is given in the specification PDF and was defined by Dr. Wilsey at the University of Cincinnati for the 2016 Spring semester. The final output simple C format is meant to closely replicate a 3-address load/store architecture.

# Compiler-Theory
Compiler written for the University of Cincinnati class EECE6083: Compiler Theory. The goal of this project is to hand build a simple recursive decent (LL1) compiler by hand (not using compiler construction tools such as flex or antlr) utilizing the C++ programming language and LLVM (for the compiler backend).
